# Text Encryption and Decryption Tool

This Python script provides a simple and user-friendly text-based interface for encrypting and decrypting messages, as well as viewing the encryption map. It includes functionality for handling a variety of characters, including letters, digits, and special characters.

## Features

- **Encrypt Messages**: Encrypts input messages using a shift cipher.
- **Decrypt Messages**: Decrypts previously encrypted messages using the reverse of the shift cipher.
- **View Encryption Map**: Displays the mapping of characters used in the encryption process.

## How It Works

The script uses a shift cipher to encrypt and decrypt messages. Each character in the input message is shifted by a fixed number of positions in a predefined character set, which includes uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special characters. The encryption and decryption mappings are created dynamically and can handle any valid character in the set.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
